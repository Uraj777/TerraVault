# 🌍 TerraVault

> **A community-driven knowledge platform built for articles, discovery, and the history behind every edit.**

TerraVault is a full-stack knowledge and community platform combining the familiar structure of an encyclopedia with a real content-management system. It is designed around **structured knowledge, human contribution, revision history, roles, and useful analytics** rather than a collection of static pages.

It is one of the larger platform projects in the **.dot** ecosystem.

## ✨ What TerraVault Provides

- 📚 **Encyclopedic articles** organized into structured categories.
- ✍️ **Content management** for creating and editing knowledge.
- 🕘 **Revision history** that records article versions instead of silently overwriting previous work.
- 🔐 **Authentication and role-aware access** for protected platform operations.
- 🧭 **Dynamic table of contents** generated from article headings with navigable anchors.
- 📊 **Admin analytics** for understanding platform activity and content metrics.
- 🧱 **Clean architecture** separating routes, services, models, templates, and utilities.
- 🗃️ **PostgreSQL-backed persistence** through Supabase, with migrations managed by Alembic/Flask-Migrate.
- 🐳 **Containerized deployment** through Docker and Docker Compose.
- ⚙️ **Production-oriented setup** with Gunicorn and GitHub Actions CI.

## 🧠 The Core Idea

```text
Discover → Read → Understand → Contribute → Review / Revise → Preserve history → Grow knowledge
```

## 🔄 Knowledge & Revision Flow

```mermaid

    R["Reader"] --> A["Article"]
    A --> E["Edit / Contribution"]
    E --> V["Validation + Permissions"]
    V --> REV["New Revision"]
    REV --> DB[("PostgreSQL")]
    DB --> A
    REV --> H["Revision History"]
    H --> A
    A --> ANA["Analytics"]
```

**How to read it:** an edit becomes a new revision rather than silently destroying the previous state. The stored history feeds both recovery/provenance and platform analytics.

## 🗺️ Product Direction

TerraVault began as an encyclopedia-style knowledge platform and is designed with room to grow into a broader **community knowledge network** — where people can discover topics, contribute, discuss, revise, and build durable collections of knowledge.
